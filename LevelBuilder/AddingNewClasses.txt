To add a new type....

0. Make a NewClass class that extends AInteractable. See the other classes in new_interactable, but the constructor should basically just take (int ticket, String path) and call "setTicket(ticket)" and "this.setPath(path)" in that constructor.

1. Add a new map to LevelManager. Preferred format is HashMap<Integer, NewClass> where it is assigned a ticket, but if tickets are not necessary a la respawnpoints this could be implemented as an ArrayList<NewClass>.

2. Instantiate it in LevelManager's constructor.

3. Modify Request to have MAKE_NEWCLASS and EDIT_OLD_NEWCLASS, and anything else you think is necessary.

4. Edit setRequest to include the new enums you made.

6. Make a "makeNewClassEditWindow()" method. It will probably take (int ticket, NewClass newClass, PropertyBook book). In this method you must make a new EditWindow, give it a submitListener, and any other necessary properties.

7. Edit receiveCoordinates() to include the new enums you made - this should call makeInteractable.

8. Edit removeEntity() to include the new enums.

9. Edit setMToPixel() to call .setRescaled on all new objects of NewClass.

10. Edit readJSON() to read in old instances.
