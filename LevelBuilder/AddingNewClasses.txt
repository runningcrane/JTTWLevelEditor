To add a new type....

0. Make a NewClass class that extends AInteractable. See the other classes in new_interactable, but the constructor should basically just take (int ticket, String path) and call "setTicket(ticket)" and "this.setPath(path)" in that constructor.

1. Add a new map to LevelManager. Preferred format is HashMap<Integer, NewClass> where it is assigned a ticket, but if tickets are not necessary a la respawnpoints this could be implemented as an ArrayList<NewClass>.

2. Instantiate it somewhere, either on declaration line or in the LevelManager constructor.

3. Modify Request to have MAKE_NEWCLASS and EDIT_OLD_NEWCLASS, and anything else you think is necessary.

4. Make a "makeNewClassEditWindow()" method. It will probably take (int ticket, NewClass newClass, PropertyBook book). In this method you must make a new EditWindow, give it a submitListener, and any other necessary properties.

5. Edit TYPES in LayerWindow to include the class tag of your new class. This will also automatically make a filter button on LayerWindow, so don't worry about doing that.

6. Edit receiveCoordinates() to include the new enums you made - this should call makeInteractable, unless more things than what's in AInteractable need to be scaled via AInteractable's setScale. See makeBoulder as an example.

6.5. If you called makeInteractable, add in a case for your new class in it using the new tag made in receiveCoordinates().

6.75. Edit the EDIT_GROUP case in receiveCoordinates() to include the new case.

7. Edit removeEntity() to include the new enums.

8. Edit setMToPixel() to call .setRescaled on all new objects of NewClass.

9. Edit readJSON() to read in old instances.

10. Edit render() to draw it.

11. Add it to ControlWindow. Hook it up to LevelManager via an Adapter and Controller().
