##CONSTANT PRIORITY
1. Add in new assets, thumbnails as they are released by meiflower.


##TOP PRIORITY
[1] Make separate collision box editor launch to make boundary boxes for each image. 
This means the level editor allows editing of the [aspect ratio] of an image instead.
Meanwhile, the collision box launch allows editing of the collision box of an image.
Thus, all instances of an image are of the same ratio, even if their dimensions differ.
1. Add slider on collision box editor launch so that larger objects can be edited.
Add viewport on collision box for more precise editing.

2. LevelEditor: option to rescale all objects on a level. 
Option to remove everything on a level.

3. Tooltips for easier use of this program.

##MEDIUM PRIORITY|
1. Make mToPixel a slider, not a textfield. 

2. Create respawn points.

3. [BUG] Fix character toggling. Currently characters can be toggle on, but not off.

##LOW PRIORITY
